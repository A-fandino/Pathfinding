# A\* Pathfinding Algorithm

That's an A\* Pathfinding algorithm coded with Vanilla JavaScript.

## How to use

- The first things the algorithm needs are the Start(ðŸŸ¦) and Ending(ðŸŸ§) points, with a maximum of 1 each.
  Put them any cell with any of the point-tool selected
- Then, the walls(â¬›) can be added to make the path harder.
- If any cell does need to be cleared, the Eraser(â¬œ) will reset it's value to default.
- If all cells do need to be cleared you can use the Clear Button.
- To start the algorithm just press "Find!"

â¬› **Wall:** Blocks the way so it cannot be used as path (Unlimited)
ðŸŸ¦ **Start:** Marks the starting point of the path (Max. 1)
ðŸŸ§ **End:** Marks the ending point of the path (Max. 1)
â¬œ **Eraser:** Resets the cells to default (Unlimited)
